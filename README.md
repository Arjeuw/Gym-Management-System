📌 Problem Statement & Objective
Gym owners often struggle with manual record-keeping, leading to errors in payment tracking and member management. This project provides a Mini Real-World Java Application designed to automate the registration, storage, and management of gym memberships through a user-friendly interface.


Objective: To implement a robust system that handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for gym records while ensuring data persistence through a database.

🚀 Features
Member Registration: Add new members with details like name, phone, and specific Indian Rupee (₹) plans.


Database Persistence: Integrated SQLite via JDBC to ensure data remains saved even after closing the app.

Search Functionality: Instantly filter and find members by their names.

Full CRUD Support: Dedicated buttons to Update member details or Delete expired records.


Modern GUI: Clean, professional interface built with Java Swing using the Nimbus Look & Feel.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Java 


GUI Framework: Java Swing 


Database: SQLite (JDBC) 


IDE: IntelliJ IDEA 


Version Control: GitHub 

📖 Core Java Concepts Applied (CO5)
This project serves as a demonstration of Course Outcome 5 (CO5):


OOP Principles: Utilizes Classes and Encapsulation for logical data structuring.


Inheritance: The GUI components extend JFrame to leverage standard Java windowing.


Exception Handling: Implemented try-catch blocks for input validation and database error management.


Multithreading: Uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater for stable and thread-safe GUI execution.


JDBC: Secure database connectivity using the sqlite-jdbc driver.
